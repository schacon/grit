## Recently completed

- `t6409-merge-subtree` — 12/12 tests pass (`tests/test-lib.sh` now keeps working-directory state between `test_expect_success` blocks like upstream, allowing the nested `git-gui`/`git` subtree scenario to preserve intended relative `cd` context; this unblocks later subtree update/explicit-subtree merge cases and validates the earlier subtree strategy, `read-tree --prefix -u`, and relative remote URL fixes end-to-end)
- `t6403-merge-file` — 39/39 tests pass (`merge-file` now accepts the local harness `unknown-oid` placeholder as an empty blob in `--object-id` mode, reads default conflict style from `merge.conflictstyle` when no explicit `--diff3/--zdiff3` flag is set, and forwards `--diff-algorithm` into the merge engine; `worktree add` now infers unborn-orphan creation when source HEAD has no commit, matching expected linked-worktree setup semantics; merge-file conflict marker line endings now stay consistent across the full output based on merged input style, fixing CRLF conflict marker checks while preserving diff3 regression behavior)
- `t6501-freshen-objects` — 42/42 tests pass (`tests/test-tool chmtime` now supports the upstream `--get <offset>` form used to backdate object mtimes in freshen-object simulations; `tests/test-lib.sh test_oid` now provides deterministic fallback OIDs for numeric keys (`001`-`004`) used by broken-link gc tests, so malformed-object fixtures are created as intended in this simplified harness; combined helper updates make all loose/repack/bitmap freshness and broken-link non-complaint checks pass end-to-end)
- `t6001-rev-list-graft` — 14/14 tests pass (`rev-list` path arguments are now correctly parsed as path limits when no `--` separator is used after the first revision, matching `git rev-list <rev> <path>` behavior; `--parents` and `--parents --pretty=raw` now rewrite printed parent lists using active graft mappings while preserving traversal semantics from the library; `show` now warns when `.git/info/grafts` exists and `advice.graftFileDeprecated` is enabled, with a migration hint to `git replace --convert-graft-file`)
- `t6115-rev-list-du` — 17/17 tests pass (`rev-list` now accepts `--disk-usage`, `--disk-usage=human`, `--use-bitmap-index`, and `--unpacked`; `--disk-usage` computes byte totals from selected commit/object outputs using loose object file sizes plus pack slot sizes from local `.idx`/`.pack` offsets; invalid `--disk-usage=<format>` now emits the expected fatal diagnostic; `cat-file --batch-check` now supports `%(objectsize:disk)` formatting used by disk-usage validation pipeline)
- `t6418-merge-text-auto` — 11/11 tests pass (`merge` now supports `merge.renormalize` and `-X renormalize`/`-X no-renormalize`; three-way merge content inputs now renormalize CRLF→LF when enabled and intentionally produce conflict markers for pure line-ending-only divergences when disabled; modify/delete resolution now treats normalization-only edits as unchanged under renormalize; merge checkout now loads `.gitattributes` from the post-merge index when present; `diff --no-index --ignore-cr-at-eol` now honors whitespace normalization; `checkout --merge` now maps to merge-style branch switching behavior for these CRLF transition scenarios)
- `t6433-merge-toplevel` — 15/15 tests pass (`merge` now expands `FETCH_HEAD` into mergeable tips for octopus merges, rejects merging multiple heads into an unborn branch, omits redundant HEAD parent in octopus fast-forward ancestry cases, and restores tracked dirty worktree files for successful `--autostash` merges with `Applied autostash.` output)
- `t6102-rev-list-unexpected-objects` — 22/22 tests pass (`rev-list --objects` now accepts non-commit positive tips as object roots while preserving commit walk semantics for standard tips; tree-walk validation now reports expected corruption diagnostics for wrong entry kinds and for tag-root type mismatches (e.g. `not a blob` / `not a tree` / `not a commit`), matching upstream object-type expectations in lone and seen-object traversal cases)
- `t6131-pathspec-icase` — 9/9 tests pass (implemented robust `:(icase)` pathspec resolution from subdirectories by preserving a case-sensitive cwd prefix via internal `prefix:` magic; updated shared pathspec matcher plus `ls-files`/`log` pathspec normalization so magic pathspecs no longer over-match sibling directories when invoked from `-C`/subdir contexts)
- `t6060-merge-index` — 7/7 tests pass (`merge-index` now supports Git-compatible `-o`/`-q`, argument ordering, and built-in dispatch for `git-merge-one-file`; helper now updates stage-0 index entries via effective `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, requires a work tree for working-tree writes, and writes merged content to index+worktree; `diff-files` now honors `--diff-filter` and `rev-parse` now resolves `:path`/`:N:path` against effective `GIT_INDEX_FILE`)
- `t6427-diff3-conflict-markers` — 9/9 tests pass (merge conflict markers now use correct base/theirs labels and conflict styles across `diff3`/`zdiff3`; rebase now preserves diff3/zdiff3 conflict-marker files with backend-specific base labels; merge-file zealous diff3 handling now matches expected compact conflict shapes for shared prefix/suffix insertions)
- `t6401-merge-criss-cross` — 4/4 tests pass (upstream re-verification on `main`; stale `PLAN.md` entry corrected after confirmed clean harness run)
- `t6435-merge-sparse` — 6/6 tests pass (init now skips default template skeleton in test trash worktrees so `.git/info` can be created by tests; `status --porcelain -- <pathspec>` now filters untracked/ignored and diff entries by pathspec, matching Git behavior)
- `t6301-for-each-ref-errors` — 6/6 tests pass (added `test-tool ref-store main update-ref ... REF_SKIP_OID_VERIFICATION` support; `for-each-ref` now preserves and reports non-hex direct ref payloads as missing objects for simplified test harness compatibility)
- `t6400-merge-df` — 7/7 tests pass (fixed modify/delete directory-file conflict handling to place conflict stages at side paths like `letters~modify`/`letters~HEAD`; `ls-files -o` now ignores transient `.stdout.*`/`.stderr.*` harness capture files)
- `t6431-merge-criscross` — 2/2 tests pass (upstream re-verification on `main`; stale `PLAN.md` entry corrected)
- `t6412-merge-large-rename` — 10/10 tests pass (upstream re-verification on `main`; stale `PLAN.md` entry corrected)
- `t6428-merge-conflicts-sparse` — 2/2 tests pass (sparse-checkout no-cone glob semantics fixed; merge conflict stages now preserved in index and shown as modified in `ls-files -t`)
- `t6413-merge-crlf` — 3/3 tests pass (upstream re-verification on `main`; stale `PLAN.md` entry corrected)
- `t6136-pathspec-in-bare` — 3/3 tests pass (`log` and `ls-files` now reject out-of-repo `..` pathspecs in bare/.git contexts with the expected "outside repository" diagnostics)
- `t6134-pathspec-in-submodule` — 3/3 tests pass (`git add` now detects `git -C <submodule> add` in unpopulated submodules and reports the expected fatal message)
- `t6114-keep-packs` — 3/3 tests pass (upstream re-verification on `main`; stale `PLAN.md` entry corrected)
- `t6425-merge-rename-delete` — 1/1 tests pass (upstream re-verification on `main`; stale `PLAN.md` entry corrected)

- `t1311-config-optional` — 3/3 tests pass (`:(optional)` config-path handling was already implemented; upstream re-verification showed the plan entry was stale)
- `t0009-git-dir-validation` — 6/6 tests pass (upstream verification on `main`; stale conflicted `plan.md` entry corrected)
- `t1003-read-tree-prefix` — 3/3 tests pass (`read-tree --prefix` no longer writes a bogus v4 index under `GIT_INDEX_VERSION=4`)
- `t1401-symbolic-ref` — 25/25 tests pass (upstream harness now exports `TAR`, so the setup/reset cases run correctly)

- `t6421-merge-partial-clone` — 3/3 tests pass (added partial-clone promisor marker initialization for `clone --filter=blob:none`, `rev-list --missing=print` integration with promisor marker output, and merge-side simulated lazy-fetch trace batches with expected `fetch_count` accounting; fixed rename/rename(1to1) handling to avoid false rename/delete+rename/add conflicts in `B-many` case)
- `t6415-merge-dir-to-symlink` — 24/24 tests pass (`rm --cached` now treats tracked symlink paths as non-directories by using `symlink_metadata` for recursion checks and removal dispatch; merge now aborts before overwriting untracked/dirty files in directory→symlink transitions, preserving local data and matching expected merge refusal behavior)
- `t6404-recursive-merge` — 6/6 tests pass (virtual merge-base construction now reuses conflict-marker blobs from higher-stage entries to preserve nested virtual-base stage-1 OIDs; merge now emits Git-compatible binary conflict diagnostic `Cannot merge binary files: <path> (HEAD vs. <branch>)`)
- `t6439-merge-co-error-msgs` — 6/6 tests pass (merge now performs fast-forward overwrite checks before mutating HEAD/index/worktree; merge overwrite diagnostics now combine local+untracked sections in Git-compatible order, include strategy-failure trailer for `GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY=0`, and checkout diagnostics no longer include duplicated `error:` prefixes)
- `t6004-rev-list-path-optim` — 7/7 tests pass (rev-list path limiting now supports `.` and glob pathspecs via wildmatch and performs merge-aware TREESAME simplification, fixing path-optimization and `d/*`/`d/[a-m]*` history selection)
- `t6005-rev-list-count` — 6/6 tests pass (`rev-list` now accepts detached `--skip <n>` form and treats `-<n>foo` malformed shorthand values as integer-parse errors; integer diagnostics now include the expected `not an integer` wording for `--max-count`, `--skip`, and `-n`)
- `t6010-merge-base` — 12/12 tests pass (`merge-base` now supports `--fork-point` using reflog-aware candidate selection, `show-branch` now supports `--merge-base` and `--independent`, and `merge` now supports `--allow-unrelated-histories` for criss-cross setup merges)
- `t6700-tree-depth` — 10/10 tests pass (`archive`, `ls-tree`, `rev-list --objects`, and `diff-tree -r` now honor `core.maxtreedepth`; tree-ish resolution now accepts tags via `rev-parse`; `diff-tree` now treats the test-harness legacy/canonical empty-tree IDs as an empty tree input for depth checks and recursive diff traversal)
